UrwCal is a "Calendar App" for the game [UnReal World](http://www.urw.fi/wiki) (also available on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/351700/UnReal_World/).

Current features (*2018-02-11*):

- Month-based calendar view with number of events at a date
- Ability to add events either "in N days" or "on specific date"
- Handles events crossing a year boundary (but only within one in-game year)
- Sorted upcoming events list with basic color coding
- You can remove events at any time (no edit though)
- Very basic "bad input" communication
- Saves state in Local Storage

The utility of this app is probably most pronounced if you like getting into farming for real.

*NOTE: I'm in no way affiliated with neither UrW team nor Steam. But I do like the game.*

## But why?

The real reason was for my to try make a "modern JS app" from scratch.

The journey has been less unpleasant than my last attempt (before React was even a thing), and I think I like the design choices behind React. The whole build env is still abominable, but hey you can hammer it to something that generally just works.

Hey I'm not a JS developer, so feel free to figure out stuff and make Pull Requests.
